## **Introduction**:

The goal of the following project will be to determine the most important features and most efficient models in classifying the price range of a phone. Knowing this information can help identify which features a phone company should focus on in designing their phones as well as giving people a model to work with which can help show the fair price of any phone based on features.

My data is composed of 2000 rows across 20 features sourced from kaggle.com with information on phone features such as battery power and pressence of 4G.

The first step was to import all the libraries I would need to move forward
